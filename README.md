Empirical_Evaluation_of_DDoS_based_Machine_Learning_Algorithms


    In this Project , we focussed on detecting attacks using five different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. We have used the CICIDS 2017 dataset.The dataset contains 8 different files represing the attacks on different schedules. First of all , we merged all the provided datasets and made a single dataset with a large dimension.On the dataset, we run K Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine models and observed the respective accuracies of each of the model . But before that, the dimension of the dataset is quite large ,hence to optimize the size of the dataset we have performed feature selection using Random Forest Classifier and top 10,20,30 features are extracted respectively . The performance of each of the models of these segregated dataset is observed. We have reduced the sample size of the dataset in 25000 , 50000 and 100000 samples and accuracy of the models are examined . Most of the cases except KNN no other models gave satisfactory results .So to increase the accuracy of the models we have examined majority voting process on the different combinations of the models.Combigning average performer models with best performers , worst performers with moderate performers and jotted down their performance.
    
    
                           We have also followed blended method where a combination of the selected models are used to  create a hybrid dataset on which we have run Random Forest Classifier model. In this hybrid approach we also followed various combinations of the defined five models in order to perceive any conclusion of the performance rate of models. At different observations, hybrid approach provided the best result by giving more than 90% accuracy, at some cases hybrid approach deduces the performance of particular model which was giving better result individually. After examining all the different dimensions of the dataset we derived a conclusion which model actually works well and when hybrid approach or majority voting needed to apply.
                           
                           
                            We also have observed  the performance of this technique by running it on multiclass as well as Bi level class datasets and noted the detection rate of each of the models as well as the approaches.
